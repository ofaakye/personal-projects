## Overview
After making an offer on a house, we discovered that the property tax on the house will be almost double of what we were 
anticipating. As such, I enlisted the use of a RAG application to help me prepare for the property tax appeal process.

## Environment
- Python 3.11.9 was used. 
- Pycharm is the local IDE used.
- Flake8 was use for python code linting. 
- llama_index was used to create chucks, embeddings and index. The Langchain framework which is more modular and flexible could have been 
used. 
- Trulens was use to evaluate the accuracy of the LLM using the RAG Triad.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to be able to interact with all the tax appeal instruction document to get a strong 
understanding of the property tax appeal process.

## Future Work
- Explore other context retrieval methods like sentence window retrieval and auto merging retrieval techniques to help improve the accuracy 
- Explore using the RAG application to estimate the expected property tax by introducing other data sources
